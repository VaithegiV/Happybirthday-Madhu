            <p>The sleepless nights, the conversations we had, the time we spent together—the way we forgot the world around us. It was just us in that small world. The way you speak, the way your eyes move, and your hands—still magical</p>

            <p>I knew you were upset about something that day and came to ask about it. You didn’t tell me why, but I felt like I needed to console you, to be there for you, and to make you happy. So I ran and picked yellow flowers for you, hoping to brighten your day. You kept the flowers like a treasure.</p>

            <small>The Heart's Longing</small> 
            <p>My mind knows that I can't get emotionally involved again and risk getting hurt, but my heart longs for love—it longs for you. You left the hostel for just two days, but it felt like two years to me. I’ve never missed someone so much before, but I did, because it was YOU! That was the moment I realized this was more than just a fleeting experience—it was something profound, something that felt like destiny itself. It was as if the universe had performing every event, every decision, to lead us to this exact point in time.</p>

            <p>I was not a perfect person, and I'm still not perfect. But you made me somewhat better. You cured the wounds... you cured the broken heart that you didn't break. You made me feel like a human who is worthy of being loved.</p>

          <small>Unexpected Soulmate</small> 
          <p> I never ever dreamt that there would be a person in my life who gave me butterflies, made me smile when being alone, made me do my best for them, made me write poems, made me travel 1200kms just to see their face. Even after a lot of hurting, I can't let go. You made me feel like life is worth living, made me forget about everything when I'm with you.You're the person who made me feel all these things.

      <small> The tension is real</small> 
      <p>I always say that without lust, love is boring. I don't know what I really meant when i say that, but lust really takes this to another level of intimacy. The trust you had in me - I realized how much a person can love someone to trust them to the core with their most secret feelings.</p>

      <p>The day you vacate the hostel doesn't even feel real. Every day I need you near me. I want to hear your voice, want to feel your presence beside me when I'm going to sleep. The memories of you help me go through the lowest phase of my life.</p>

      <p>I won't say that I haven't made you cry, but seeing you cry is my weakness. I can't handle it. I've used harsh words, yet you still choose to be with me. I haven't fulfilled some of your expectations, but you still come back to me every time I leave. </p>

      <h2>Reality Hits 🥺</h2>
      <small>The Slow Fade of Us</small> 
      <p>Days go by, months pass, a year finishes, and it becomes hard for both of us. The long distance is hell. Everything started to change little by little. You don't want this, then I don't want this, but neither of us can let go. Conversations become short. Sleepless nights turn into "I'm going to sleep." Talking for two to three hours becomes "I have a headache." Priorities change. Careers occupy our minds. Still, the heart wants what we had and what we were. At the end, it should be us against the problem, but it became you vs me.

      <h2>Oppsites ↔️</h2>
      <small>Lost in Translation</small> 
      <p> 
        I wanted you to change for me, but you loved me the way you are. This is what broke our bond. Our expectations didn’t match, leading to countless arguments and misunderstandings. We experienced many ups and downs and often thought about how toxic we had become. But the love we shared during the first ten months wouldn't let us be apart.

      <p>I know that whatever happens, we will still have that attraction for each other no matter what, until someone replaces the other. Until that, it’s always you for me, and me for you.

  Lastly, this isn't a complete picture of what we had or what our whole relationship is about, but some important turning points. Maybe it’s not the same as before but I'll always love and care about you. We're individuals of our own. So, knowingly or unknowingly, I don’t want to control your feelings and emotions. But still I'll expect somethings and will shout or get angry because the mind knows that you are not only for me but the heart wants you only for me. I can't control it especially when it's you. But still I fucking love you and cherish this beautiful chapter of my life. Some things are beautiful but incomplete, and I guess we fit into that category. And here we are heart full of love and mind full of confusion. We know there's no future for us, but we can't stop falling for each other. Some people meet the right person at the right time, some meet the wrong people, but we're the example of right person, wrong time. Maybe in the next life (if there is one), without socity norms and complexities, I hope we can meet with the same love and life(பேராசை தான் but 😁).Aprm Happy birthday nga...
